  <p>Title: Environmental Transformative Justice: Responding to Ecocide</p>

  <p>Abstract: My dissertation’s central objective is to normatively devise ethically appropriate sociopolitical and juridical 
    responses to ecocide (i.e., grave environmental harm). More specifically, the work seeks to philosophically engage the 
    ethical question of what is owed to human societies that are displaced due to intentional environmental destruction.
  </p>

  <p>Ultimately, my dissertation attempts to remedy these situations by bringing environmental issues under the purview 
    of the discipline of Transitional Justice. The novelty of such an approach is its assertion that ‘social transformation’ 
    rather than merely ‘correcting the harm done’ or ‘restoring the status quo’ is necessary for overcoming these kinds of 
    wrongs because absent social change, the conditions that reinforce, entrench, and reproduce these sorts of injustices 
    remain in place.
  </p>

  <p>Since the focus is on transforming communities’ relationships and interactions with their environment, instead of 
    simply repairing the damage from past injuries, my dissertation offers a full account of what I call environmental 
    transformative justice. To achieve this my dissertation establishes the context in which environmental transformative 
    justice is operative because of harm suffered (i.e., social death and loss of vital interests stemming from intentional 
    environmental destruction) and the manner in which the harm occurred (i.e., direct, indirect, or negligent state action); 
    employs a Rawlsian constructivist theory of justice to determine its ideal aims; offers guidance on how to pursue these 
    aims by exploring the relationship between constructivist and comparative approaches to justice (e.g., Amartya Sen and 
    Martha Nussbaum); identifies actors' responsibilities for pursuing these aims by developing a notion of common but 
    differentiated responsibility based on Iris Young’s two-tiered model of responsibility, and supports the assertion that 
    environmental transformative justice ought to be pursued from within a Transitional Justice framework, by demonstrating 
    ways in which Transitional Justice mechanisms (e.g., criminal tribunals, truth commissions, public apologies, pardons, 
    lustration, memorialization, reparations, and constitutional conventions) can assist in furthering environmental aims 
    (i.e., promoting ecological sustainability, preservation, and restoration).
