  <h2>Dissertation Abstract</h2>

  <p>My dissertation's central objective is to normatively devise ethically appropriate sociopolitical 
    and juridical responses to ecocide (i.e., grave environmental harm). More specifically, the work seeks 
    to philosophically engage the ethical question of what is owed to human societies that are displaced due 
    to intentional environmental destruction.
  </p>

  <p>The motivation behind the project stems from the lack of academic research (excluding a pocket of 
    recent analysis of the international community’s obligation to assist ‘climate refugees’ -- a subset of 
    people displaced due to environmental destruction) involving the question: “What ought to be afforded victims 
    of environmental harm?” The dearth of scholarship is surprising, considering growing global concerns, vis-à-vis 
    accelerating rates of environmental degradation, which if allowed to continue, will generate wide-ranging national 
    and international environmental crises and disasters in the twenty-first century and beyond.
  </p>

  <p>Thus, the dissertation attempts to remedy this situation by bringing environmental issues under the 
    purview of the philosophical species of justice known as Transitional Justice. The novelty of such an approach 
    is its emphasis that ‘social transformation’ rather than merely ‘correcting the harm done’ or ‘restoring the 
    status quo’ is necessary for overcoming these kinds of wrongs because absent social change, the conditions that 
    reinforce, entrench, and reproduce these sorts of injustices remain in place.
  </p>

  <p>Since the focus is on transforming communities’ relationships and interactions with their environment, 
    instead of simply repairing the damage from past injuries, the dissertation offers a full account of what I 
    call environmental transformative justice that specifies the context in which it is operative, determines its 
    ideal aims, offers guidance on how to pursue these aims, and identifies actors’ responsibilities for pursuing 
    these aims. The hope is to provide post-ecocide communities insight and guidance on how to best remodel, alter, 
    and remove (pre)existing conditions responsible for generating wrong(s); while correcting the harm(s) victims 
    suffered.
  </p>

  <p>To this end, the first chapter establishes the circumstance of environmental transformative justice, in 
    that it delineated the particular social settings that trigger the normative concerns to which environmental 
    transformative justice is responsive. It achieves this by illustrating normatively relevant ways that the wrongs 
    of ecocide fall within the purview of Transitional Justice due to the harm suffered (i.e., social death and loss 
    of vital interests due to intentional environmental destruction) and the manner in which the harm occurred (i.e., 
    direct, indirect, or negligent state action).
  </p>

  <p>The second chapter attempts to establish the full class of actors that have a role to play in overcoming 
    the injustice of these circumstances. It seeks to develop a conception of responsibility that is persuasive, 
    politically useful, and reasonably acceptable to the parties involved, while assisting in countering inaccurate 
    and misleading narratives that disguise accountability (both over-inclusively and under-inclusively) for ecocide. 
    Essentially, the chapter argues that to adequately discharge responsibility actors must engage in shared public 
    activity (i.e., political action) to oppose, resist, and alter the background institutions and practices generating 
    the cases of ecocide under discussion.
  </p>

  <p>The third chapter begins by employing a constructivist approach to determine the ideal principles of environmental 
    transformative justice. Second, it applies a comparative justice approach to establish how to proceed when enacting 
    environmental transformative justice measures. Finally, the concluding section demonstrates ways in which Transitional 
    Justice mechanisms (e.g., criminal tribunals, truth commissions, public apologies, pardons, lustration, memorialization, 
    reparations, and constitutional conventions) can assist in furthering environmental aims (i.e., promoting ecological 
    sustainability, preservation, and restoration).
