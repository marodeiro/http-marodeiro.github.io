  <p>I am an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Mississippi State University. 
    Previously I taught at Baruch College, City College, FIT, and Marymount Manhattan College. 
    I primarily work in the intersection of Environmental Philosophy and Political Philosophy. 
    As a traditional liberal political philosopher, I am interested in exploring the 
    possibilities of revitalizing liberalism so as to better deal with contemporary 
    socio-political issues.
  </p>

  <p>I completed my Ph.D. in Philosophy at the CUNY Graduate Center in Spring 2020. 
    My dissertation, entitled Environmental Transformative Justice: Responding to Ecocide, 
    combines insights from Transitional Justice and Environmentalism into what I define as 
    environmental transformative justice as a means of delineating the normatively appropriate 
    responses to intentional acts of environmental destruction. My dissertation was supervised 
    by Omar Dahbour with Michael Menser, Jeffrey Blustein, and Charles Mills making up my committee.
  </p>

  <p>I am an active public speaker: I have been invited to lecture at the Brooklyn Academy of Music 
    as part of their Questioning Democracy Lecture Series and have given talks at Strand Bookstore 
    and other venues throughout New York City.
  </p>   

  <p>Also, I received a J.D. from Fordham School of Law in 2010.</p>
